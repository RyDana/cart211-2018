			<h2>Website proposal</h2>
            <p>Emulators are pieces of software that one can run on their machine, to simulate the system of another machine. It is widely used in the video game domain. Game development companies often cannot text their games on consoles that haven’t been released yet, so they will test them on emulators of the desired consoles that will run on their PCs, for example. Another use for emulators is for people who possess games from a console that they want to play, but do not possess the console itself. Emulators can not only be installed on PCs, they can be installed on a wide variety of machines, including different consoles, as long as those have the power requirements to run the emulator. One can, for example, emulate the Original PlayStation system on their android phone.</p>
            <p>Emulators are often free and open source software. They do not necessitate licenses and are part of the creative commons. One can thusly install their favorite console system for free. The website Emuparadise offers a great summary on what emulator can be installed on a certain machine. Emuparadise also used to offer a multitude of games, for a wide variety of consoles, downloadable for free, that can be played on those emulators. Data of games that used to be contained in cartridges (such as games for the Nintendo Entertainment System) are called ROM files, whilst data of games that used to be contained in CD/DVDs (such as games for the Sony PlayStation) are called ISO files.</p> 
            <p>Around August 2018, the game company Nintendo sued two major ROM/ISO-offering websites, LoveROMs and LoveRETRO, asking them to pay 150 000$ for every Nintendo ROM they openly distribute, stating that those websites hurt their sales. Being small websites curated by video game enthusiasts and unable to pay such sums, LoveROMs and LoveRETRO either shut down completely or removed all their download links. Similar websites, such as Emuparadise, also removed all their ROM and ISO download links out of fear of being sued. Ironically, Nintendo does not offer clients to purchase practically any of their retro games. It has been stated that the amount of money they stated the company looses due to emulators has been grossly exaggerated. However, they have announced that they will offer a subscription-based service where users pay a monthly fee to play a multitude of games, including some retro ones, on Nintendo’s latest console, the Switch. Not only launch of this service has been delayed by months, but it is predicted that this service would only offer the most popular retro Nintendo games, throwing the rest of them into oblivion.</p>
            <p>The issue of game preservation is thusly brought to the forefront. There are not enough organisations that put time and effort to preserve retro videogames, which have arguably been an important part of western culture for the last forty years. The website Archive.org allows users to “stream” a limited number of retro games on an embedded emulator, but this “streaming” does not allow for a full experience of the games (such as saving your progress, for example). The responsibility had thus fallen on enthusiasts, who have devoted much effort to create websites that curate and explain games, as well as offer screenshots, ratings, and, most importantly, access to those games. With companies suing those enthusiasts and forcing to shut down their websites, accessibility to those ROMs and ISOs is greatly diminished. Individuals would either have to go through the inconvenience of tracking a physical copy of the game, and hoping that it is not a knock-off, or revert to peer-to-peer file sharing services.</p>
            <p>Peer-to-peer file sharing services, such as torrent websites, have their own set of inconveniences. They are often difficult to navigate and are not secure. They do require some knowledge on how the service works. Additionally, those websites have a strong association with digital piracy.</p>
            <p>My proposition for the website is to create three different webpages that portray three alternative realities as to how retro games could be acquired by the public. 
            The first webpage will portray the corporate reality, the one that offers those video games through corporate means. It will consist in the creation of a fake subscription-based service from which consumers, paying a monthly fee, can have access to a selected collection of a company’s old videogames. The company might also offer the consumer to download an “app”, for an additional price, which will be the emulator software itself. The company might even wish to play an advertisement for one of their games while the player is trying to emulate another game. Since the company will have control over all the software, they might even slightly modify the retro games, maybe to avoid displaying outdated or disturbing imagery, text or ideas. This fake subscription service will necessitate the creation of a webpage that is visually highly-polished. Emphasis should be put on marketing techniques that this company will use to sell their subscription, or try to sell other services or products (e.g. highly visible “BUY” or “GO PREMIUM” buttons). It is important that the amount of games offered is limited, since the company would not sacrifice money on refurbishing games that don’t attract the most amount of people.</p>
            <p>The second webpage will portray an alternative reality where retro video games are all in the public domain. The video games will be preserved in a fictitious archive by a fictitious organisation. The fictitious organisation will possibly allow users to download the ROMs and ISOs they desire, for free. The webpage might organise its lengthy list of games in a logical order (by console and alphabetical order, for example). The curation and explanation of those games should not be extensive, as the organisation might not have the means or the staff necessary for such endeavor. It might have a big banner at the top asking for donations to keep the webpage running. Visually, it should have quite of a bare look and be quite unornamented. It should have a formal look.</p>
            <p>The third webpages will portray an alternative reality where retro video games can only be acquired though piracy. It will be inspired by peer-to-peer file sharing services. This webpage should not be intuitive to use and should require multiple steps before the user obtains either their emulator or their retro game. The user of my website might have to search on other websites the information necessary to learn how to navigate a typical file sharing service. The user should also be made aware of the risks of downloading pirated files. It might be possible to create a fake “blue screen of death” whenever the user decides to download a file that turns up to be malware. However, the webpage can offer a very extensive list of different ROMs, ISOs and even emulators. The webpage should be quite bare, with minimal use of images (except maybe for strange advertisements) and have quite poor UI.</p>
            <p>The user, coming to my website, might be tasked to find a specific video game to download. They will have to find it using all three alternatives, one at a time. This will allow the user to experience different ways of exploring archived retro video games and decide which might be the best one.</p>
