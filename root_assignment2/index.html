			<h2>Website proposal</h2>
            <p>My proposition for the website is to create three different webpages that portray three alternative realities as to how retro games could be acquired by the public.</p> 
            <p>The first webpage will portray the corporate reality, the one that offers those video games through corporate means. It will consist in the creation of a fake subscription-based service from which consumers, paying a monthly fee, can have access to a selected collection of a company’s old videogames. The company might also offer the consumer to download an “app”, for an additional price, which will be the emulator software itself. The company might even wish to play an advertisement for one of their games while the player is trying to emulate another game. Since the company will have control over all the software, they might even slightly modify the retro games, maybe to avoid displaying outdated or disturbing imagery, text or ideas. This fake subscription service will necessitate the creation of a webpage that is visually highly-polished. Emphasis should be put on marketing techniques that this company will use to sell their subscription, or try to sell other services or products (e.g. highlighted “BUY” or “GO PREMIUM” buttons). It is important that the amount of games offered is limited.</p>
            <p>The second webpage will portray an alternative reality where retro video games are all in the public domain. The video games will be preserved in a fictitious archive by a fictitious organisation. The website “archive.org” is currently allowing users to try out some retro games, using the MAME emulator. However, it does not allow to download them and save one’s own high score. The fictitious organisation that I will create the webpage for will possibly allow users to download the ROMs and ISOs they desire, for free. The webpage might organise its lengthy list of games in a logical order (by console and alphabetical order, for example). It might have a big banner at the top asking for donations to keep the webpage running. Visually, it should have quite of a bare look and be quite unornamented. It should have a formal look.</p>
            <p>The third webpages will portray an alternative reality where retro video games can only be acquired though piracy. It will be inspired by peer-to-peer file sharing services. This webpage should not be intuitive to use and should require multiple steps before the user obtains either their emulator or their retro game. The user should also be made aware of the risks of downloading pirated files. However, the webpage can offer a very extensive list of different ROMs, ISOs and even emulators. There can be a voting system that places the most trusted files at the top of the page. The webpage should be quite bare, with minimal use of images (except maybe for advertisements) and have quite poor UI.</p>
            <p>The user, coming to my website, might be tasked to find a specific video game to download. They will have to find it using all three alternatives, one at a time. This will allow the user to experience different ways of exploring archived retro video games and decide which might be the best one.</p>
