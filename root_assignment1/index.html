            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <p>My name is Dana and it is my first year in the Computation Arts program. It is last year that I've gotten really interrested in coding and decided to pursue it academically. I like thinking logically, working with people and getting creative. Plus, I'm on my computer or a mobile device a good 70% of my waking time so it just all made sense. I can't wait to learn how to make the most flamboyant web page I could ever make, and my process towards it could all be witnessed right on this website. I'm hoping to use those skills, in addition to many others, to generate entertaining and thoughtful virtual experiences.</p>
