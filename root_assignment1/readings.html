      <h1>Reading 1 - As we may think</h1>
      <p>Dr. Vannevar Bush's article raised a few concerns about scientific progress post-war. The first is that scientific progress is fueled by collaboration, and the best incentive to collaborate at the time was so that the nation could win the war.  I seems to me that today, a time of relative peace, scientific progress is achieved in well-established organizations or companies that have the power and the means to explore new opportunities. Such companies are inciting the brightest minds to associate and work with them, allowing collaboration between their numerous employees within it. However, those companies are in competition with each other, and it is unclear whether that competition is pushing or slowing scientific progress.</p>

      <p>Another of Bush's concern was the classification and publishing of knowledge, and the difficulty of finding that knowledge when needed.
      Bush reassures that they had the means of recording knowledge in faster and more effective ways, and that those tools were only going to improve with time, thus predicting multiple technologies that we possess today. Here bush denotes the cyclicality of scientific progress: an improvement in the manufacturing and efficiency of scientific recording tools would allow a more effective spreading of scientific knowledge, which in turn allows scientists to more easily build on each other's work, contributing to scientific progress yet again. However, Bush underestimated the speed at which those tools will develop, stating that "It is a far cry from the abacus to the modern keyboard accounting machine. It will be an equal step to the arithmetical machine of the future" (chapter 4). We are here, 70 years later, with machines that not only perform repetitive calculation tasks, but machines capable of what he called "mature thought", i.e. artificial intelligences.

      <h1 id = "R3">Reading 3 - Web Work: a History of Internet Art</h1>
      <p>It was interesting to explore, through this article, what art on the web looked like some 20-25 years ago. It was mentioned, from the beginning, that net.art primarily investigates subjects such as immediacy and immateriality, to which I can personally connect to, since those are themes that I am strongly interested in and that, today, are prevalent in my immediate environment more than ever. Greene explained that the web has its strengths in being accessible and equitable, since an artist has the possibility to connect not only with an audience, but also with their community, without the need to be institutionally recognized. This accessibility offers freedom from bureaucracy, but also freedom from geographical and social borders, since the web supports international and cross-culture communication. This freedom allows for a diversity of opinion, a chance for a conversation, an exchange of ideas, all giving the participating communities more strength. Greene states that marginalization on the web was existent, but still encouraged an openness where minorities could shine and lead a “positive cultural reform”. One could question if, today, the web is too accessible, and expressing your opinion is too easy. I am thinking of social media platforms, where a whole debate could be started over what a celebrity had for breakfast. I am also thinking of extremist forums, echo chambers propagating controversial and possibly disturbing ideas. One could question the value and the benefits of those conversations being accessible to many people, and if they really strengthen our community.</p>
      <p>It is interesting to put in contrast what motivated people in the pre/early-2000’s to publish on the web, versus what motivates them today. Greene shares the idea that of “software as culture”: software not used for purely practical purpose, but software that reflects the culture at the time. Publishing was motivated by the intrinsic value of the content, rather than financial gain. The web had an anti-corporate flare, even if colonization by mainstream media was already starting. One of the examples given is the Heritage Gold software, a Photoshop knock-off with tools and filters reflecting societal problems. A counter example to that, in today’s world, is an iPhone application allowing users to “beautify” pictures of themselves. The “beautify” filter makes the skin lighter and gives the user more European features. The filter is applied using artificial intelligence, meaning that a machine has accumulated data of what a multitude of people generally find more attractive, and then uses that data to apply the filter on the user’s portrait.  The filter was removed because people blamed the company for being racist, disregarding the why or the how. By just removing that feature, the software does not question itself or the culture it’s in, it remains solely used for a practical purpose. This is a confirmation of Greene’s statement that “Very few of the tools and materials – including software and computers – that we work with every day are scrutinized to reveal the ways in which they reproduce, support or simply permit oppressive social or economic relations.” For a software or a website to economically survive, it needs to be morally correct and purely practical to receive traffic. Thusly, the web has become more corporate and formal. The sole act of offering access to internet has become a corporate move, as shops and chain restaurants attract its consumers with free WiFi.</p>
      <p>Knowing all this, Greene’s articles gives me a desire to explore “hacktivism”, as I feel I have become more aware of the formality of the web, even if I use it to my advantage.
