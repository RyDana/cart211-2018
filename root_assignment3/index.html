   <h1 class='text-center'>Emulators, ROMs and who they belong to</h1>
   <p>There are multiple ways for an individual to acquire information or bodies of work for their study or enjoyment. One can buy books or films at stores or rent them at libraries. With the Internet, however, there is an emergance of consuming content through digital means. One can, for example, view e-books in online libraries. Organisations offer a multitude of content to explore. Individuals can thusly explore and contribute to their culture.</p>
    <p>A reltively new medium has been contributing to Western culture with increasing strength: video-games. Their history is thus important to preserve. Numerous communities have been collecting a multitude of videogames from the previous decades, not only for their own consumption, but for the purpose of achiving. However, videogames of the previous decades were mostly stored physically, either on CDs or cartriges. Those are very easily degradable, thus data was extracted from those to save it on computers. This data takes the form of ROM files (extracted from cartriges) or ISO files (extracted from CDs).
   </p>
   <p>
    One can state that information is much more valuable when it is acessible to the public. In the previous decade, individuals created ROM and ISO databases, freely acessible through websites. One can thus download those and explore a culture of the past. In the recent year, however, major companies have been sueing those organisations for copyright infringment. It was done in the hopes of limiting access to those retro videogames, because companies wish to create new products and services offering them. Those services have however been unsatisfying to consumers. Since digital libraries do not usually offer videogame loaning, and physical game copies are hard to find or expensive, downloading retro games from illegal sources have thus kept their popularity.
